Then, maybe even more surprisingly, they released Aaron Jones. There is to still be room for a backup RB, but if they decide to fill this need in the draft, it won't be very valuable barring a Jacobs injury.`,

        RB: `The Bears made one of the first moves of free agency when they signed D'Andre Swift to a 3-year deal. Expect him to be the primary back in this offense, but he does have an injury history that could open the door for a second option.`,

        RB: `Ty Chandler came on over the second half of the season, and ex-Packer, Aaron Jones, signed on for 1-year.

Alternatively, the Vikings might draft a bigger body for short yardage situations.`,

        WR: `McCarthy showed us this year that as long as he's at the helm with Dak he's going to air it out. With Gallup's decline and Cooks old age, a rookie WR could be productive behind Ceedee. It would be hard to expect enough target share for a second option to be better than a weekly WR2.`,

        RB: `Out goes Saquon Barkley and in comes Devin Singletary in the first day of free agency. Devin should soak up much of the carries that Saquon leaves up for grabs up for grabs.

        TE: `Despite his injury struggles, Darren Waller is still a good TE when he's on the field. In addition, their backup, Daniel Bellinger, is a solid TE in his own right. If Waller decides to continue to play, there won't be much use for another TE.`}},

    posLandingAnalysis: {QB: `Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, and Curtis Samuel make for a strong receiving corps in DC. With the right coaching staff, their rookie QB could have an immediate fantasy impact.`, 
        RB: `After agency, the Commanders backfield is occupied by Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler. While we don't think either of these guys are game breaking talents currently, it seems very unlikely that Washington would draft another RB. If the do, its still a very crowded RB room.`, 
        WR: `Jahan Dotson had an extremely disappointing sophomore year, leaving questions on if he can fill the role as the Commanders WR2. With this talented WR class, if they choose to replace Dotson, their rookie selection could have value along side Terry McLaurin.`,

    posLandingAnalysis: {QB: `Kirk Cousins is now on contract as the Falcon's QB for the next 4 years. Provided he plays well, it's unlikely that there would be any upside for a rookie QB outside of another Kirk injury. `, 
        RB: `Bijan Robinson was a top-10 fantasy RB in 2023 in despite of Arthur Smith's attempt to drive fantasy managers senile. With Tyler Allgier already there as well, there's no space for a rookie.`, 
        WR: `Atlanta seems to be employing the shotgun approach to filling their WR2 need behind Drake London by signing plenty of free agents. The most nota=ble signing has been Darnell Mooney. However, with this strong WR class, a rookie could take Mooney's role. Now that Raheem Morris has his QB in Kirk Cousins, expect this offense to look very similar to Sean McVay's Rams which have historical provided two fantasy relevant WRs.`, 
        TE: `With Raheem Morris and Kirk Cousins in town, there is hope for a Kyle Pitts breakout. If he doesn't perform this year in a non-Arthur-Smith-led offense, give up. For now, let's give him another chance and not believe a rookie TE will take his role.`}},

        RB: `Miles Sanders was extremely disappointing in 2023. Still, he is an above average RB and his running-mate, Chuba Hubbard looked pretty good in spite of the poor offense. A rookie RB in Carolina wouldn't be likely to find success.`, 
        WR: `Carolina traded for Diontae Johnson during free agency. He should slot in as their WR1 immediately. Still, there should be room for a 2nd option as Adam Thielen is reaching the end of his career. With the O-line improving through free agency, maybe Bryce Young will have time to make his reads.`, 
        TE: `A good TE is a rookie QBs best friend. While Bryce Young is no longer a rookie, we can look at him and this offense like he is. If he gets a sure-handed, big-bodied target over the middle, there may be fantasy relevancy there.`}},

        TE: `The Saints' haven't been using their TEs in the receiving game very much lately. However, Juwan Johnson is only to the team for one more year. With coaching changes and TEs moving on, there could be room for a rookie to make some noise.`}},
