        analysis: "Jeanty’s 2024 campaign at Boise State was nothing short of legendary, cementing him as the premier RB in this draft class. His 2,601 rushing yards and 29 TDs led the nation, with his yardage total being second all-time. At a hair under 5’9” and 211 lbs, he’s built to absorb contact and his contact balance is 1-of-1, yet he also has the explosiveness it break big plays. His 7.0 YPC reflects efficiency, often turning modest gains into chunk plays. His 17 receptions for 197 yards don't show his true PPR upside as he had a very large part of the receiving game the year prior. Pass-blocking is solid, ensuring he stays on the field for third downs. Critics might point to his heavy college workload—374 carries in 2024—as a durability concern, but his compact frame suggests he can handle NFL punishment. Jeanty’s tape screams workhorse potential, and his ability to score from anywhere makes him a fantasy goldmine. He should put up RB1 numbers as a rookie. He's a blue-chip talent that could anchor dynasty rosters for years.",

At 6’4” and 219 lbs, he’s a towering target with elite body control who has a knack for making contested catches and dominates red-zone looks. McMillan’s routes are surprisingly polished for his frame, but he still isn't a perfect separator. He’s not a burner, and his lack of elite top-end speed shows when corners play off, but his long strides eat cushions fast. Against press coverage, he can occasionally get bogged down by physical DBs. His 15.0 YPC reflects big-play ability. While not a YAC monster, he can sneak up on defenders. Arizona leaned on him heavily, with 28% of team receiving yards, a testament to his gravity as a focal point. He has elite hands, and drops are not a concern. Fantasy-wise, McMillan has WR1 upside, but his landing spot will be key. He’s as close to a sure thing as this class offers.",

His combine testing only confirmed the explosion that he shows on the field; he has the ability to break long runs. While he isn't an elite receiving back, he should command a decent target share in most offenses. He is a willing blocker, but his technique is shaky, but that can be coached up.

At 6’0” and 188 lbs, he's a little smaller than you'd like, but his ability to beat press-man coverage shows size might not always matter. His most impressive trait is his ball skills which show on both sides of the ball. 50/50 balls don't exist when Hunter is in the mix. His route-running is an interesting study. While juggling two positions, he clearly hasn't had the time to master his technique, but his elite athletic ability and feel for the game minimize most shortcomings. Travis Hunter is simply a rare talent that has all the upside in the world. Sadly, he'll only ever reach his ceiling as a WR if he stops playing CB in the league (which seems unlikely). Given the immense upside, you can justify taking him as high as 1.02, but just make sure you understand that it could be a burnt pick.",

At 6’2” and 219 lbs, he’s built to withstand NFL hits, though his pocket presence wavers, leading to 18 sacks in 2024, per ESPN. His 67.2% completion rate reflects precision, particularly on deep outs and seams, where his velocity carves defenses. Ward’s off-script brilliance is unreal—escaping pressure to flick 30-yard dimes mid-scramble, channeling a young Russell Wilson with sharper accuracy. His 204 rushing yards and 4 TDs add sneaky fantasy spice, though he’s no dual-threat dynamo. Decision-making soared in 2024, with a 5.6:1 TD-to-INT ratio showcasing growth, but he occasionally forces throws into traffic, risking picks. Mechanics need refinement; sloppy footwork under duress causes 12% of throws to sail, per PFF. Miami’s offense hinged on him, generating 43% of team yards, elevating a modest supporting cast. Fantasy-wise, Ward’s a superflex QB1 with top-6 upside in 1QB leagues. His arm projects 4,100-4,400 passing yards and 30-35 TDs in a pro-style system, with 300-400 rushing yards and 4-6 TDs boosting his floor. His sack rate could stall drives behind weak O-lines, but his playmaking mitigates risk. If paired with a creative OC and solid weapons, think C.J. Stroud’s rookie year with a dash of mobility. Ward’s not a finished product—anticipation and pocket poise need work—but his ceiling screams franchise QB. Dynasty managers should target him aggressively if he slips past top QBs, as his youth (22) and highlight-reel throws promise weekly fireworks.

Three fumbles in 2024 flag ball-security issues. Fantasy-wise, Skattebo’s a PPR RB2 with RB1 upside, projecting 1,200-1,400 total yards, 10-12 TDs, and 50-60 catches in a balanced offense. Think Rachaad White with more goal-line juice. Dynasty managers value his three-down skillset, but his age tempers long-term upside. In a pass-heavy system, RB12-18 production is realistic.

Loveland’s 29% target share, despite subpar QB play, underscores his reliability, commanding 35% of Michigan’s receiving yards.

His routes pop with suddenness—think Antonio Brown’s twitch, minus the polish—creating windows on double moves and posts. Golden’s hands are reliable (1 drop), and his tracking on deep balls is elite, snagging 3 TDs over 30 yards. He’s not a physical beast, struggling in contested spots (22% win rate), and his YAC (28% of yards) relies on quickness over power. Texas spread targets thin, giving him a modest 19% share, but his efficiency screams upside. A minor ankle tweak in 2024 is a slight concern, but his frame looks durable. Fantasy-wise, Golden’s a WR3 with WR2 potential in PPR. His TD knack and 50+ catches project 800-1,000 yards in a pass-heavy offense, with 6-8 scores realistic. He’s best as a No. 2 or slot guy—think Diontae Johnson with less volume—but his ceiling hinges on scheme fit. If he lands with a gunslinger who peppers underneath, 70 catches and WR25-30 production are in play.

His twitchy cuts and vision shine on outside zones, with 3 runs over 40 yards showcasing breakaway speed. Tuten’s 27 catches for 239 yards and 2 TDs, with 32% YAC, make him a PPR asset, flipping screens into first downs. His 14 TDs—30% of VT’s rushing scores—highlight red-zone reliability. Virginia Tech leaned on him for 32% of rushing yards. However, his 206-lb frame and 230 carries in 2024 raise durability concerns, with a 2023 hamstring tweak lingering. Pass-blocking is weak, often overpowered, risking third-down snaps, and he struggles in short-yardage (2.7 YPC). Fantasy-wise, Tuten’s a PPR RB3 with RB2 upside, projecting 800-1,000 rushing yards, 8-10 TDs, and 35-45 catches in a spread offense. Think Tony Pollard with rawer polish. Dynasty managers love his athleticism, but his ceiling caps without a three-down role. In a creative system, RB20-25 production is realistic. A high-upside pick with big-play flashes.",

At 5’11” and 190 lbs, he’s a lean speedster with a blistering 4.40 40 and 36.5” vertical, complemented by a 9’11” broad jump that screams explosiveness. His tape pops with vertical juice, blowing past corners on go routes (25.3 YPC against man coverage) and stacking defenders on the boundary with ease. Williams’ release package is electric—quick feet and hip shifts shred press coverage, creating early separation, and his 505 yards and 9 TDs against man coverage show he’s a DB’s nightmare. His YAC ability sparkles, with 15 missed tackles forced on 35 catches in 2023, per PFF, turning slants into 20-yard gains. He’s alignment-versatile, splitting time outside (70%) and in the slot (25%), and his feel for zone coverage is uncanny, settling into soft spots with veteran savvy. His 14 TDs tied for second in WSU single-season history, a testament to his red-zone knack. The knocks? His hands are inconsistent—4 drops in 2024, per ESPN, often letting balls fall to his chest—and his route tree needs polish, with rounded breaks on curls that savvy NFL DBs could jump. His 190-lb frame struggles against physical corners, losing 60% of contested catches, and his blocking is subpar, potentially limiting early snaps in run-heavy schemes. A minor ankle tweak in 2022 raises slight durability flags, and his age (23) tempers long-term upside. Fantasy-wise, Williams is a PPR WR3 with WR2 upside. His speed and YAC project 60-80 catches, 900-1,200 yards, and 8-10 TDs as a No. 2 or slot option. Think a less refined Rashod Bateman with more juice or a poor man’s Elijah Moore with vertical pop. If he lands in a spread offense with a precise QB, WR20-25 production is realistic, with weekly spikes to WR15 on big plays. Dynasty managers should love his breakout production and athleticism, but his floor dips if he’s stuck in a physical scheme or buried in a deep WR room. He needs a West Coast or spread system to shine—power-run teams could stunt him.

Horton’s routes are crisp, shredding zones with slants, and his hands are elite—zero drops in 2024. His 13.6 YPC and 32% target share highlight his role as CSU’s go-to guy. YAC (28% of yards) shows twitch, but his slight frame struggles against press, with a 23% contested-catch rate. A 2023 ankle tweak flags durability concerns. Fantasy-wise, Horton’s a PPR WR4 with WR3 upside, projecting 60-80 catches, 800-1,000 yards, and 5-7 TDs in a slot or No. 2 role. Think Jakobi Meyers with less volume. Dynasty managers like his floor, but his age (23) and modest physicality cap his ceiling. In a West Coast offense, WR30-35 production is realistic. A safe pick for steady catches with sneaky upside.",

        analysis: "Jordan James is a sturdy grinder, powering Oregon’s ground attack with 1,099 yards and 13 TDs at 5.9 YPC. At 5’9 1⁄2” and 205 lbs, he’s compact, shrugging off 25% of tackles, per ESPN, with sharp vision in zone schemes. His 9’9” broad jump and 4.55 40 fuel modest burst, with 2 runs over 40 yards, while his 13 TDs—30% of Oregon’s rushing scores—highlight goal-line reliability. James’ 15 catches for 132 yards and 1 TD add PPR utility, handling checkdowns effectively. His pass-blocking is dependable, anchoring blitzers to secure third-down snaps. Oregon’s balanced offense capped him at a 33% rushing share, raising workhorse concerns, and 3 fumbles in 2024 flag ball-security issues. A 2023 knee tweak lingers as a durability note, and his 4.55 speed limits breakaway potential. Fantasy-wise, James is a standard-league RB3 with RB2 upside, projecting 900-1,100 rushing yards, 8-10 TDs, and 20-30 catches in a committee. Think Zack Moss with less volume.

        RB: `The Bears made one of the first moves of free agency when they signed D'Andre Swift to a 3-year deal. Expect him to be the primary back in this offense, but he does have an injury history that could open the door for a second option.`,

        RB: `Ty Chandler came on over the second half of the season, and ex-Packer, Aaron Jones, signed on for 1-year. Given that neither of these guys have the durability and size to handle a large workload, they'll likely split the backfield. Alternatively, the Vikings might draft a bigger body for short yardage situations.`,

        RB: `Pollard left in free agency. If they don't address the position in free agency, expect them to draft a rookie RB and give him a significant workload.`, 
        WR: `McCarthy showed us this year that as long as he's at the helm with Dak he's going to air it out. With Gallup's decline and Cooks old age, a rookie WR could be productive behind Ceedee. It would be hard to expect enough target share for a second option to be better than a weekly WR2.`,

        RB: `Out goes Saquon Barkley and in comes Devin Singletary in the first day of free agency. Devin should soak up much of the carries that Saquon leaves up for grabs up for grabs.

        WR: `We haven't seen a consistent producer in the Giants WR room since Odell. However, there will be more than ample opportunity for a rookie WR this year. Even with the less-than QB play, this should be a solid spot for an incoming WR.`, 
        TE: `Despite his injury struggles, Darren Waller is still a good TE when he's on the field. In addition, their backup, Daniel Bellinger, is a solid TE in his own right. If Waller decides to continue to play, there won't be much use for another TE.`}},

    posLandingAnalysis: {QB: `Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, and Curtis Samuel make for a strong receiving corps in DC. With the right coaching staff, their rookie QB could have an immediate fantasy impact.`, 
        RB: `After agency, the Commanders backfield is occupied by Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler. While we don't think either of these guys are game breaking talents currently, it seems very unlikely that Washington would draft another RB. If the do, its still a very crowded RB room.`, 
        WR: `Jahan Dotson had an extremely disappointing sophomore year, leaving questions on if he can fill the role as the Commanders WR2. With this talented WR class, if they choose to replace Dotson, their rookie selection could have value along side Terry McLaurin.`,

    posLandingAnalysis: {QB: `Kirk Cousins is now on contract as the Falcon's QB for the next 4 years. Provided he plays well, it's unlikely that there would be any upside for a rookie QB outside of another Kirk injury. `, 
        RB: `Bijan Robinson was a top-10 fantasy RB in 2023 in despite of Arthur Smith's attempt to drive fantasy managers senile. With Tyler Allgier already there as well, there's no space for a rookie.`, 
        WR: `Atlanta seems to be employing the shotgun approach to filling their WR2 need behind Drake London by signing plenty of free agents. The most nota=ble signing has been Darnell Mooney. However, with this strong WR class, a rookie could take Mooney's role. Now that Raheem Morris has his QB in Kirk Cousins, expect this offense to look very similar to Sean McVay's Rams which have historical provided two fantasy relevant WRs.`, 
        TE: `With Raheem Morris and Kirk Cousins in town, there is hope for a Kyle Pitts breakout. If he doesn't perform this year in a non-Arthur-Smith-led offense, give up. For now, let's give him another chance and not believe a rookie TE will take his role.`}},

        RB: `Miles Sanders was extremely disappointing in 2023. Still, he is an above average RB and his running-mate, Chuba Hubbard looked pretty good in spite of the poor offense. A rookie RB in Carolina wouldn't be likely to find success.`, 
        WR: `Carolina traded for Diontae Johnson during free agency. He should slot in as their WR1 immediately. Still, there should be room for a 2nd option as Adam Thielen is reaching the end of his career. With the O-line improving through free agency, maybe Bryce Young will have time to make his reads.`, 
        TE: `A good TE is a rookie QBs best friend. While Bryce Young is no longer a rookie, we can look at him and this offense like he is. If he gets a sure-handed, big-bodied target over the middle, there may be fantasy relevancy there.`}},

If they do, that WR could quickly overtake Shaheed as the WR2 on this team, a valuable spot with the attention Olave draws.`, 
        TE: `The Saints' haven't been using their TEs in the receiving game very much lately. However, Juwan Johnson is only to the team for one more year. With coaching changes and TEs moving on, there could be room for a rookie to make some noise.`}},

        RB: `Sean McVay seems to have found his workhorse in Kyren Williams making this a backfield with limited available opportunity. With this year's subpar RB class, there isn't a likely path for Kyren to lose his job.`, 
        WR: `Puka Nakua broke records last year in his rookie season. He got his chance as a result of father time and injuries catching up with Cooper Kupp. As Puka replaces Kupp completely, there leaves room for a new Robert Woods role in the future. If they find the right guy, there could be fantasy value.`, 
        TE: `The Rams extended Tyler Higbee in the 2023 season prior to him tearing his ACL in the Wild Card round. That being said, their rookie, Davis Allen, stepped up in Higbee's absences. Unless they draft one of the top TEs this year, it's unlikely that there will be much change.`}},
